                                            <p> I developed a model which incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss. The model is unusually broad and end-to-end, encompassing a wide geographic scope and long time horizons. I hope that it inspires similiar on other global catastrophic risks.

I added a python analysis, got it running multi-threaded, made a singularity container for it, and added lots of comments and some documentation. However, the code is sufficiently legacy that I do recommend interested parties generally start with a more modern crop model, such as <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/environmental-research/facilities-tools/software-models-and-databases/wofost.htm">WOFOST</a></p>

                                            <p>Have you ever thought about the fact that the frequency band of speech is fairly narrow, all things considered, and a gaussian white noise spectrum that is quiet in the majority of audible frequency space would block speech quite well? I have! This script records audio, generates a spectrogram, fetches audio statistics, and plays back audio with adjusted volume in real-time based on the system volume. It's great for blocking voices at coffee shops and communal spaces, but it doesn't have to be very loud as it focuses the audio only on the frequency range that is the loudest in the environment. It works great in combination with noise-cancelling headphones. I cannot figure out why this is not a standard feature in noise canceling headphones! Hopefully they add it eventually. </p>

                                            <p> This tutorial will walk you through a standard Git workflow, which includes creating a new branch, checking its status, adding changes, committing them, and finally, pushing them to the remote repository. The workflow also includes how to prepare for a pull request. This is basic knowledge that seems to currently not be widespread and tutorials don't really seem to focus on the key basics. Professional software engineers really need to learn this kind of thing if they haven't already, so I made a little tutorial.</p>
